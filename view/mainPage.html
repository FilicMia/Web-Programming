            Briscola is often played with Italian cards with suits of
              swords (spade), clubs (bastoni), cups (coppe) and coins (danari).
              In this case the cards rank from the highest to the lowest
              is ace, three, King (re), Horse (cavallo),
              Jack (fante), 7, 6, 5, 4, 2.</br>

            Also, the cards have a point value:
          </p>
          <ul id="cardPoints">
            <li>Ace 	<span class="points">11 points</span></li>
            <li>Three 	<span class="points">10 points</span></li>
            <li>King 	<span class="points">4 points</span></li>
            <li>Queen 	<span class="points">3 points</span></li>
            <li>Jack 	<span class="points">2 points</span></li>
          </ul>

          </br>
          <p>The remaining cards have no point value.</p>
          <p>
            As you see, the total value of cards in the deck adds up to 120
            points. The player which scores at least 61 points in a game wins.
            Games can end in a draw when both reach the same point total (60).

            The computer shuffles the deck and deals three cards to each player.
            It then takes a card (the seventh, in this case) and puts it face up
            under the pile of undealt cards, which are placed face down.
            The face-up card suit defines which will be the Briscola suit
            for the game (adut).
            The Briscola suit is the trump suit, i.e. the suit which always takes
            all other cards, card ranking notwithstanding.

           The game starts. The first to play is the player (A).
         </p>
         <ol>
           <li>A leads one of his three cards, face up.</li>
           <li>B plays one of his cards.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>
           B wins or loses the trick according to these three simple rules:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li> If B plays a card of the same suit as the card led by A,
              then the trick is won by whoever played the higher card - the winner
              takes both cards away, and puts them, face down, in a pile near him.</li>
            <li>
              If B plays a card which has a different suit from the card which A
              led, but neither card is a Briscola (trump), A wins the trick, and
              the cards will go to A, even if B's card was of higher rank.
            </li>
            <li>
              If B plays a card of a different suit from A's, and one of the cards
              is a Briscola (trump), then the player of the Briscola wins the trick.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Example (Briscola is the four of spades):</p>
          <ul>
             <li>Player A leads the 5 of clubs.</li>
             <li>Player B plays the ace of clubs. B takes the trick (Rule 1).</li>

             <li>Player A leads the 5 of hearts.</li>
             <li>Player B plays the King of clubs. Player A takes the trick (Rule 2)</li>

             <li>Player A leads the ace of diamonds.</li>
             <li>Player B plays 6 of spades (briscola). He wins the round (Rule 3).</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="note">
           Note that Briscola is unlike many card games, in that there is no
           obligation for the second player to play a card of the same suit as the
           first card or to trump it, just because he can. The second player is
           free to play any of his cards.
         </p>
         <p>
          Note that if both players play a briscola, rule 1 dictates that the
          higher ranking card wins.
         </p>

         <p>After each trick, each player draws a card from the pile of undealt
           cards. The winner of the trick draws first, followed by the loser.
           The player who won the trick then leads to the next one.
         </p>

         <p>Eventually the undealt cards will be used up, and at this point the
            loser of the trick just played will draw the face up Briscola card.
            The game then continues, without drawing cards, until all the cards
            have been played.
         </p>

         <p>At the end, each player takes the pile of cards he won in tricks during
            the game, and counts up the points according to the point scale shown
            above. The player with more points wins, or if each has 60, it is a draw.
