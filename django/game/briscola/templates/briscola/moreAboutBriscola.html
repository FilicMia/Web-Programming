  <p>Most parts of Italy have their own regional pattern with latin
  or French suits. Latin suited cards, with suits of swords (spade),
  batons (bastoni), cups (coppe) and coins (denari)
  (<span>used in Briscola</span>), are prevalent in
  the North-East (where the pip cards have curved swords and straight
  batons which cross in a trellis), and in the South (where the pip
  cards have short separate swords and batons). Elsewhere the regional
  patterns are French suited, with suits of spades (picche), clubs
   (fiori), diamonds (quadri) and hearts (cuori). Most of the regional
  cards come as 40 card packs; 52 card versions of the North-Eastern
  Italian regional patterns are also made for certain games.

  Various forms of Italian suited Tarot cards (Tarocchi) are used in
  Bologna, Piemonte and a few places in Sicily. The international
  French suited 52 card pack is also widely available. German suited
  cards are used in the German speaking South Tyrol. The 40 card single
  suited Cuccù pack is used in some regions in the north.</p>

  <p>Italian 40 card deck is used for playing Briscola.
  It is often
  played with Italian cards, which have suits of coins, cups, batons
  and swords, but you may play using a standard international 52-card
  deck, just by removing the Jokers, eights, nines and tens. The same
  game is played in the coastal regions of Slovenia and Croatia under
  the name Briškula.</p>
