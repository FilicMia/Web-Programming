#### Description of the solution ####
The solution will include:

1. Interactive interface
2. Instructions to the user how to play Briscola card-game
3. Deployment of playing cards protocol based on card game rules
4. Deployment of Monte Carlo algorithm or/and Random algorithm to simulate Computer playing
5. Instructions to the user how to use the application

The final product is an online application.
Main part in development takes card-game and web programming.<br />

*Application development is separated into 2 parts:*

1. Client side development:

	1. The frame and organization of the site 
	2. Static page HTML/CSS 
	3. Interaction using JavaScript
	
2. Server side development:

	i. Using ASP.NET MVC and Visual Studio 2012 (IDE)
